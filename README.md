# About jtag_shield 

This project is a shield for Arduino Mega, which exposes a JTAG connector so that programming/debug can be performed by tools such as Atmel-ICE. The concept and a prototype build is discussed in more detail at http://www.eevblog.com/forum/microcontrollers/a-simple-'jtag-hat'-board-for-the-arduino-mega/

Designed with KiCad v4.
